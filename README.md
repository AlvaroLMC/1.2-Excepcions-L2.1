# 📚 Exercise: Exception Handling with Scanner

## 📝 Description

This project consists of the implementation of a class called `Entry`, which handles various exceptions that may occur when entering data via keyboard using Java's `Scanner` class.

The main goal is to ensure secure and validated input for different data types (`byte`, `int`, `float`, `double`, `char`, `String`, `boolean`), by capturing both `InputMismatchException` and a custom exception.

All methods receive a `String` parameter with the message to be displayed to the user and return the corresponding validated input.
